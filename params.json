{"name":"lcov to Cobertura XML Converter","body":"This project does as the name implies: it coverts code coverage report files in [lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php) format to [Cobertura](http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/)'s XML report format so that CI servers like [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org) can aggregate results and determine build stability etc.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n    python lcov-to-cobertura-xml.py lcov-file.dat\r\n\r\n - `-b/--base-dir` - (Optional) Directory where source files are located. Defaults to the current directory\r\n - `-e/--excludes` - (Optional) Comma-separated list of regexes of packages to exclude\r\n - `-o/--output` - (Optional) Path to store cobertura xml file. Defaults to ./coverage.xml\r\n\r\n## Caveats\r\nThis was originally intended to convert [JsTestDriver](http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/) coverage results, so it may not work properly with all LCOV constructs. If you have any problems or suggestions, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/eriwen/lcov-to-cobertura-xml/issues) and it'll be addressed\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThis project is provided under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).","tagline":"Converts lcov line coverage output to Cobertura-compatible XML for continuous integration","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
